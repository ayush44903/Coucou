Project Overview
CouCou – A Multi User Chat Application

Project Overview
CouCou is a next-generation social app tailored specifically for Gen Z. It aims to revolutionize digital communication by moving beyond outdated, impersonal chat platforms. CouCou is not just a messaging tool—it’s a vibrant, purpose-driven digital space for authentic connections.
At the core of CouCou’s uniqueness is its Aura Points system, which quantifies social engagement and encourages meaningful interactions. Features like a minimalist UI, a Weekend Scheduler, and an intuitive interface set CouCou apart as the ultimate Gen Z chilling destination.

Team Structure
The development of CouCou is spearheaded by a core team of four developers, working collaboratively to bring this innovative concept to life. The team adopted a flat structure to enable creative freedom and shared ownership.
